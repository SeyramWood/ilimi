   <h5>Mahaman Sani A. Souleymane: CEO de Kakaki Multimedia</h5>
   <q>
    The FONAF forum was a great experience for us, young entrepreneurs. It was a unique opportunity that Kakaki did not fail to seize. Personally, it allowed me to make my company well-known, as well as to meet and talk to other company directors. I would like to thank the iiLab very much for the support they provide us on a daily basis, for the emergence of Kakaki, and for this opportunity which was for Kakaki a source of acquisition of major partners.

   <h5>Abdoul-Rachid Maman Kadad, The Sahel Solar Energy Academy</h5>
   <q>
    It was thanks to the A.D.U. iiLAB that the Sahel Solar Academy was given an opportunity to participate in the FONAF forum. It was an amazing and a unique experience, it opened us the doors to world business and new relationships. The participation in the event also strengthened our communication skills as we had a chance to talk to business representatives, officials, partners as well as potential investors. It was an opportunity for us to expand our network as the majority of the participants were coming from all eight regions of Niamey. We can't wait to participate in the upcoming FONAF National forum.
