Our career services department prepares A.D.U. students for the future of work and creates school-to-work pathways for our students, graduates, and alumni. Through guided internships and job placements, as well as hosting career fairs, workshops, and seminars, we empower our students with the requisite skills and competencies such as digital adaptability, leadership, communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, professionalism, teamwork and collaboration to enable them to thrive in the workplace.
