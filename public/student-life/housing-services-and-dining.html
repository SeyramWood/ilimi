  <p>A.D.U provides housing services for all its MasterCard Foundation (MCF) Scholars. However, for the other students who come in from outside Niamey and Niger, the university helps to secure comfortable houses through the third-party options
There are two canteens on campus currently, each running from 8.30 am to 4.00 pm daily, with a small convenience store by the University gate that provides snacks, refreshments among other things. Students can choose from the different menus provided by the restaurants.
